# Educational Management System (not completed on time, must be resumed)

This is a school project aimed at learning Python and Tkinter. The project implements an Educational Management System with various features for managing students, courses, enrollments, and teachers.

## Project Overview

The Educational Management System is designed to provide an intuitive graphical interface for managing educational data. It utilizes Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and SQLite for database management.

**Note: This project was not completed on time, and i must resume it. Some planned features may not be fully implemented or functional.**

## Goals

1. Create a user-friendly interface for managing educational data
2. Implement CRUD operations for students, courses, enrollments, and teachers
3. Provide search functionality across different modules
4. Learn and apply Python and Tkinter programming concepts
5. Gain experience with SQLite database management

## Features

### Implemented Features

- Database creation and structure
- Student management (add, edit, delete, search)
- Course management (add, edit, delete, search)
- Navigation between different management interfaces

### Planned Features

- Enrollment management
- Teacher management
- Displaying enrolled courses for a student
- Displaying enrolled students for a course

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies (Tkinter should be included with Python).
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. (Optional) Use the provided sample database file to populate the system with initial data.
5. Run the `dbcreate.py` script to set up the database structure:
   ```python
   python dbcreate.py
   ```
6. Launch the main application:
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```
7. Use the main dashboard to navigate between different management interfaces.

## Sample Data

To help you get started quickly, we provide sample database file that you can use to populate the system with initial data. These files will be available in the repository, allowing you to test the application's functionality without having to create elements one by one.
